With RPM-based systems
----------------------

	rpm[build] -ts PACKAGE.tar.gz

builds perl-PACKAGE.src.rpm

	rpm[build] -tb PACKAGE.tar.gz

builds perl-PACKAGE.ARCH.rpm

	rpm[build] -ta PACKAGE.tar.gz

builds both of them.



Standard installation
---------------------

On most systems, just do this from the command line:

	perl Makefile.PL
	make test
	make install

and watch errors after each step.

To be sure on most Unix systems you can:

	perl Makefile.PL && make test && make install



Non-standard installation
-------------------------

To install to a non-standard place (e.g., under your own home directory),
or try this:

	perl Makefile.PL PREFIX=$HOME LIB=$HOME/lib/site_perl
	make test
	make install

See how to install perl modules by running 'perldoc perlmodinstall'.

If you have problem with this above, try my own fix:

	perl Makefile.PL prefix=$HOME
	make test
	make install

Don't mix PREFIX and LIB parameters with prefix, use only one or another!


To use the installed module from non-standard place, set environment
variables:

 export PERL5LIB=$HOME/lib/site_perl
 export MANPATH=$HOME/man:$MANPATH
